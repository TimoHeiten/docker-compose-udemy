Create with a distributed system with docker-compose!

1.) Create the Dockerfiles for the python scripts (consumer & producer)
2.) Create the RabbitMQ Dockerfile
2.) Create the MariaDb Dockerfile
3.) Create the docker-compose file:
    Create a network for all services
    build all services with docker-compose build and docker-compose up
    Verify the data in the mariadb
    and that rabbitmq is working properly (http://localhost:15672) --> make sure to publish this port at least

Hints
rabbitmq
    Dockerfile
        --> execute the bunny.sh as the entrypoint
    docker-compose:
        you want to expose 15672:15672 and 5672:5672
    hostname needs to be (required by the applications structure): 
        bunny1

python
    pip install <pakacke-name>
    produce
        pika
    consume
       pika
       mysql-connector-python

mariadb:
    /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/
